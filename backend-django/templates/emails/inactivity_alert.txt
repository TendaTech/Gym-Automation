We Miss You, {{ member.full_name|title }}!

Come Back to the Gym!

It's been {{ days_since_checkin }} days since your last visit, and we wanted to reach out because we miss seeing you!

We understand that life can get busy, but remember:
- Your fitness goals are still waiting for you
- Every day is a new opportunity to get stronger
- Your gym family is here to support you
- Even a short workout is better than none

Getting back on track is easier than you think:
- Start with just 20-30 minutes
- Try a beginner-friendly class
- Book a session with a personal trainer
- Bring a friend for motivation

Remember, the hardest part is just showing up. Once you're here, you'll remember why you started your fitness journey in the first place.

We're here to help you get back on track. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need any support or have questions about getting started again.

Looking forward to seeing you soon!
The Gym Team
